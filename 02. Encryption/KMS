# Key Management Service #
Allows symmetric and asymmetric encrypt, i.e, the same key can be used to encrypt and decrypt or have different public and private keys;

**Purpose**: Management encryption keys for data protection and compliance;\
**Features**: Key creation, rotation, management and access control;\
**Integrations**: Work with various AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EBS and Amazon RDS;\
**Compliance**: Supports FIPs 140-2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs);\

## Concepts ##

**CMK**: a logical representation of a cryptographic key used for encryption and decryption;\
**Key Material**: actual cryptographic material (random bits and bytes) used for encryption and decryption, stored securely in KMS;\
**Envelope Encryption**: process of encrypting plaintext data with a data key, and then encrypting the data key itself with a CMK;\
**Key Policies**: JSON  document that define permissions and controls for a CMK;\

## Access Control and Permissions ##
IAM Policies: attach policies to IAM entities;
Key Policies: permissions and controls for a specific CMK;
Grants: delegate specific permissions to other AWS Accounts or AWS Services;

## KMS Integrations ##
S3, EBS, RDS, Lambda, etc

## Best Practices ##
- **Separate keys per application or environment**: different CMKs for each application or environment to minimize the blast radius in case of a security breach;
- **Enable key rotation**: Regularly rotate keys;
- **Principle of least privilege**;
- **Monitor and audit**;
