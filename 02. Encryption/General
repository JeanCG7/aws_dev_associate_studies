# Encryption #

## At-rest ##
Use by default in many AWS services, optional to others. Data isn't being transited encrypted, it's just when stored.
Key Management: **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** for managing encryption keys;
- Definition: protecting data when it is stored;
- Purpose: prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information in case of data breaches or physical theft;

**How to Implement?**

It depends on the service, e.g:
- **S3**: Use server-side encryption with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) or customer-provided keys (SSE-C).
- **EBS**: Encrypt EBS volumes and snapshots using KMS keys;
- **RDS**: Enable encryption at rest for database instances and snapshots;
- **Redshift**: Encrypt data within Redshift clusters using KMS keys or hardware security modules (HSMs);
- **DynamoDB**: Data always encrypted at rest, you can choose any key;

Key types

- AWS Owned Key: Managed by AWS, no KMS involved;
- AWS Managed Key: Created and managed by AWS, stored in KMS;
- Customer Managed Key: Created, owned and managed by you, stored in KMS;
  
## In-transit ##
All communication with AWS Services is encrypted in-flight. The network traffic between AWS data centers is transparently encrypted at the physical layer.
- Definition: protecting data while it is being transmitted between systems or services;
- Purpose: prevent data interception, eavesdropping or tampering during transmission;
- Protocols: TLS/SSl, HTTPS and other secure communication protocols;

**How to Implement?**

It depends on the service, e.g:
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Use HTTPs for secure communication between clients and API Gateway;
- **AWS Transfer Family**: Use SFTP, FTPS or HTTPs to securely transfe files to and from Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS;
- **Amazon VPC**: Implement AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect for secure connections between on-premises and AWS environments;
- **Amazon RDS**: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt connections between clients and RDS instances;
- **API/CLI**: All communication is encrypted using standard TLS encryption;

## Best Practices ##
- Both types are crucial for securing your data in AWS;
