# Elastic Beanstalk #
Fully managed service that allows you to quickly deploy, manage and scale applications;\
**Features**: Automated infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, monitoring and scaling;

## Responsibility ##
**User Manages**: Code Development;\
**AWS Manages**: Capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling and application health monitoring;\

## Concepts ##
**Applications**: collection of EBS components, such as environments, versions and configurations;\
**Environments**: specific application deploymen with a unique URL and an associated AWS infrastructure;\
**Application versions**: unique, labeled iterarion of your application code, stored in Amazon S3;\

## Configuration ##
**Environment Tiers**: Choose between the Web Server tier for web applications or the Worker tier for background processing;\
**Configuration Templates**: Save environment settings and configurations for easy reuse accross multiple environments;\
**Customization**: Modify settings, such as intance type, auto-scaling group settings and custom domain names;\

## Deployment Strategies ##
**All-at-Once**: Update all instance simultaneously, causing a brief downtime;\
**Rolling**: Update instances in batches, maintaining partial availability. Use ELB to remove unhealty hosts from service;\
**Rolling with Addiotional Batch**: Update instances in batches while launching an additional batch to maintain full capacity;\
- costs more
**Immutable**: Launch a new, full set of instances with the new version, then swap them with the old instances;\

## Scaling ##
**Auto scaling**: Automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand and custom scaling policies;\
**Load balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across instances using Elastic Load Balancing;\
