# AWS SDKs Overview #

It's a collection of libraries and tools that assists with AWS service integration in your preferred programming language;\
**Key Features**: Simplified API interactions, automatic error handling and efficiente resource management;\
**Configuration**: Set up AWS credentials and configure the SDK to connect to the appropriate AWS region;\
**Usage**: Import the required AWS service client, create instances and interact with AWS services programmatically through your application code;\
**Features**:
- **Automatic retries**: SDKs handle request retries for intermittent erros, improving application reliability;
- **Pagination**: Manage large result sets using built-in pagination suport.
- **Authentication**: Automatically sign request with AWS credentials to ensure communication;

## AWS APIs ##
- Application Programming Interface;
- Set of rules and protocols that enable communication between software components;
- **Restful APIs**: AWS APIs follow the REST architecture style, utilizing standard HTTP methods;
- **AWS API Gateway**: A managed service to create, publish and manage APIs for your applications;
 
### How to use ###
- Direct API Calls: HTTP requests using RESTful methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE);
- Authentication: sign API request using AWS Signature Version 4;
- Rate limiting: API rate limits and implement proper error handling for rate-limited requests;
  
## Best Practises ## 
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling an dretry mechanisms for transient errors;
- **Performance**: Use connection pooling and optimize API calls for better performance;
- **Security**: Follow the principle of least privilege and avoid embedding AWS Credentials in application code;
- **Read API documentations**

## AWS API - Authentication ##
- Calculated with secret key and access key are used to calculate the AUTHPARAMS to call AWS APIs;
  - Authorization HTTP header or query string param;
- CLI and SDK sign requests automatically!
- Prevents data manipulation in transit and protects against replay attacks;
