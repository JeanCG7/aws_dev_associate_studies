## Data Consistency ##
Accuracy and reliability of data stored in a system.\
**Examples**: 
- RDS: relational databases;
- DynamoDB: NoSQL database;
- ElastiCache: In-memory caching service;

## Caching ##
- Storing frequently accessed data in memory or disk;
- Speed up web applications, reduce database load and improve UX;
- **Invalidation**: removing cached data when it becomes invalid or stale;
- **Examples**:
  - ElastiCache: TTL feature;
  - CloudFront: manual invalidation, scheduled invalidation and real-time invalidation;
  - Lambda: flexible way to invalidate cache entries based on custom rules, such as time-based, event-base or used-based;

**Best Practises when CRUDing on AWS**
- Use managed database services;
- Use caching services to reduce database load and improve performance;
- Use cache invalidation to ensure data freshness and consistency;
