## Data Classification Fundamentals ##
Defined as the **categorizing data based on sensitivity and criticality** to identify appropriate **security controls and comply with regulatory requirements**. It's necessary to classify data in order to have **improved data security, risk management and regulatorly compliance**. 

Some classifications levels:
- Public
- Internal
- Confidential
- Highly Confidential

How to classify data in AWS?
1. Identify types and sources;
2. Define classification and categories based on sensitivity and criticality;
3. Classify using automated tools or manual processes;
4. Implement security controls and policies based on classification levels;
5. Regularly review and update data classification to maintain accuracy and relevance;

Secure Credential Handling in AWS
- **AWS Secret Manager**
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**
- **AWS Identify and Access Management(IAM)**
- **AWS Security Token Service (STS)**
    - Temporary security credentials for short-term access;

**Best practises**
- NO CREDENTIALS ON CODE OR CONFIG FILE;
- IAM roles for EC2 instances and other AWS services;
  - Instead of giving straight forward a key to a developer, create a instance that he can access to comunicate with a specific service;
- Rotate access keys, passwords and oteher secrets regularly;
- Limit permissions following the principel of least privilege;
- Implement MFA for sensitive operations;
